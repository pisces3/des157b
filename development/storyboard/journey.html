        <p>From the feedbacks we got from user journey, I learned that targeting to elementary students who always have access to phones might not be a very feasible target audience especially since we're using AR as our interactive media and it could be complicated for kids to understand. Also, it would probably take funds if we introduce our app in the classroom setting since teachers may have to require field trips around Downtown. Hence, Kaelyn suggested that we can target it to prospective UC Davis students who want to learn more about the history and overall vibe of the Davis community. We also discussed having multiple QR codes but realized that it may cause more complcations as it's complex.</p>
