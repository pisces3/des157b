        <p>During paper prototype testing, Matthew and Kim were quite confused on what we're trying to showcase and what the eggheads are supposed to do. They were also quite unsure if they can only access the locations once they're on-site or if they can play around with our website remotely. I think we need to be clearer that we're showing AR graphics or animation and add more instructions on how to activate them.</p>
