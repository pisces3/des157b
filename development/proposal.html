            From the three possible project ideas, I decided that I want to do my second choice which is the map-based interface that will showcase photos about what people love about Davis. I think my target audience for this is 12 years and older. As of now, I don’t think I plan to work with a partner.

            Following the map-based interface idea, I probably would only show the map of Davis and each photo will have its own symbol or label depending on what category from the wheel it falls under. The users can click on the symbols then a side bar that shows the full picture, date, location, description of what they love about Davis would show up. There could also be a feature where users can see it in colored groups either sorted by categories or location. One other idea that I have is that the interface would look like the Davis centennial seal and the pictures will be placed on the actual seal itself. Like when users first enter my website, they would see the seal but instead of the engraved pictures that it has right now, they would see a collection of pictures categorized by the seal’s categories. For example, I know one of the wedge is like the arts and culture so Davis pictures that show or relate to arts and culture would be in that wedge. I also kinda wanna make it like polaroid style and hip and trendy. It would be fun if users can add filters and add some text just like in a real polaroid!

            I kinda want to outsource the photos from Instagram since a lot of people use that to post pictures especially in Davis. I’m concerned if it would be possible to get Instagram API to embed pictures into my project. If that doesn’t work out, I’m hoping that users could upload their own images. I’m concerned that uploading pictures not knowing the size and the format would be hard. I was thinking it could be a form where they can upload their pictures, pick the category that would fit best, date, location, etc.. I’m also debating whether I want this to be a mobile version or desktop version.
