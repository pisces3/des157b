            The Momset website has a scrapbook aesthetic as illustrated by the typography, colors and overall layout. The background color is light beige but the font colors are bold and bright like orange and green to make it pop. As for how they displayed the pictures, when users scroll up or down, the picture carousel instead scrolls horizontally which creates a dynamic interaction design. However, it can also disrupt user experience since they may expect to go up and down but instead it's going left and right. Because the pictures are positioned like a scrapbook, it feels genuine and natural which I'm aiming to do for my website.

            This website aims to teach students the periodic table by showing the real-life picture of each element in their respective spots. The users can click on each element and an overlay would appear that shows more information about that element and more pictures. What works with this website is that it helps students visualize what the real elements look like by placing it in an actual periodic table. One issue this website has that sometimes affect its overall user experience is that there are some delays with the overlays
