        <h2>Thoughts on the Centennial Seal</h2>
        <p>When I visited the seal, the triangular panels sparked my interest specifically the one that focused on art and dancing and the Davis Farmers market. After reading the articles, the inner ring which featured the story of the Patwin people who were the original settlers of the land also sparked my interest. I hope to touch on either of these sectors in my capstone project or even find a way to incorporate both of them.</p>
